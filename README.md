Peer Review: Brandon Le - First I liked how the code looked very neat and organized. It was very easy to follow along with. I like how he chose Green Papaya for one of his thai options! I did the same :) He had a lot of variety in options and I liked that. Also the formatting when it's printed into the console is nice to read and it's spaced out well. I liked that a lot because I try to do the same with my code. When it looks nice it adds to the experience. Overall really good project. I would like to see if at the end there could be specific statements to continue playing "(YES/NO)" instead of hitting any key to try again. It also needs to have data validation if it's possible for you to add that. But other than that I'd say really nice job! The loops did their job also.
